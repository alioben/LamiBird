# LamiBird
	Simple game created in processing using Java.
	The aim of this game is to  travel the longest distance possible and avoid obstacles.

# Requirement
	This game uses the library gifAnimation which is not supported by the latest versions of Processing. The library is available at this link https://github.com/01010101/GifAnimation, and you can install it manually by copying the main folder into your "libraries" folder in your Processing sketchbook.

# The game
	The background: A static picture that rolls infintely.
	The animated characters: Gif picture animated using gifAnimation library.
	The stars and obstacles: The disposition of the stars and obstacles can be modified by editing the files obstacles.txt and stars.txt (Each '1' represents an obstacle/star and each '0' represents an empty space that can be used as a padding. The patterns are separated by a '|', and a '-' represents a new line).
